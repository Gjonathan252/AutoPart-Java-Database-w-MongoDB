# AutoPart-Java-Database-w-MongoDB

Database project created using Java and a connection to MongoDb. Java Connects to the database client using mongodb java dependencies on mavan. The project is ready to be build and run java -jar autopartsjavamongodb-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar.

There are many more tools that can be added to this project such as database manipulation, editing, or editing. I chose to not continue doing this project as they can be easily added using the dependencies libraries. This is a pure command line project as there is no website connected to make this work. 

How can I improve this project.
I would redo the entire project using springboot mongodb dependencies. I would also create a angular project to run a boilerpoint project of bootstrap and pull all the data into a easily readable website. I will be back to this project and change it entirely allow a website to run simultaniously like my other project found here: https://github.com/Gjonathan252/User-Manager-Application.

As a previous autozone employee I have organized the data in a similar fashion they have organized their data. Pulling only the stored data from the store.

Store 5662 is the store we will be using to demonstrate our example.

Data will be stored on MongoDB as followed.
